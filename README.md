### About this data
Online property companies offer valuations of houses using machine learning techniques. The aim of this report is to predict the house sales in King County, Washington State, USA using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.
We will predict the sales of houses in King County with an accuracy of at least 75-80% and understand which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.‚Äù

The dataset consists of house prices from King County an area in the US State of Washington, this data also covers Seattle. This data was published/released under CC0: Public Domain. 

The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 21613 observations. 

## Deep Learning
This tutorial demonstrates using Keras (https://keras.io/) to build a TensorFlow-based model for recognizing handwritten digits. This walkthough builds the most basic type of deep nerual network, a mulit-layer perceptron (MLP), consisting of:

1 input layer of 784 neurons
2 hidden layers of 512 neurons each, with randomized dropout
1 output layer of 10 neurons
